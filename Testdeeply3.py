Here is the Python code to convert:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python

x = 10
y = 20

if x > 5:
    if y > 15:
        if x + y > 30:
            print("Both x and y are large, and their sum is greater than 30.")
        else:
            print("x and y are large, but their sum is not greater than 30.")
    else:
        print("x is large, but y is not greater than 15.")
else:
    print("x is not large.")
```
Note that in Python, we use indentation to define blocks of code instead of curly braces. Also, in Python, we use the `print` function to display output on the screen, while in Perl, we use `print` as a statement.
