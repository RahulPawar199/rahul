This code defines three functions: `generateMultiplicationTable`, `printMultiplicationTable`, and `processNestedLogic`. The first two functions are used to generate a multiplication table up to a given size and print it in a formatted manner, respectively. The third function is used to check if the sum of three numbers is even or odd, and prints the result.
The main execution uses these functions to define a size for the multiplication table and generate, print, and process it using nested loops.
