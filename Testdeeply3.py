Here's the converted Python code:
```
x = 10
y = 20
if x > 5:
   if y > 15:
      if x + y > 30:
         print("Both x and y are large, and their sum is greater than 30.")
      else:
         print("x and y are large, but their sum is not greater than 30.")
   else:
      print("x is large, but y is not greater than 15.")
else:
   print("x is not large.")
```
