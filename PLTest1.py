Here's the equivalent Python code:
```
# Python code with if-else conditions
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
```
Note that in Python, we use indentation to denote block of code, whereas in Perl, we use curly braces { }. Also, in Python we use "print" function instead of "print" statement.
